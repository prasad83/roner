RONER (ROunded corNER Generator)
--------------------------------

I got inspried from the article: http://ajaxian.com/archives/rounded-and-shaded-corners

This work is derived from the actual implemenation:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tapestry/tapestry4/trunk/tapestry-contrib/src/java/org/apache/tapestry/contrib/services/impl/

I have done some enhancements where you can give background color to both inner or outer to rounded corners.

To get more details refer to the documentation in the docs folder.

Usage:
======

1. You can use Roner offline and same the images to the file. [Scripts are in bin directory]

    On Windows

    roner.bat -c blue -w 100 -h 100 -bc white -a tl -f tl.png
    roner.bat -shadow true -bc white -ibc efefef -w 100 -h 100 -aw 10 -ah 10 -sw 5 -o 0.99999 -f shbox.png
    
    On Linux [make sure to run dos2unix on roner.sh and give executable permission]
    
    roner.sh -c blue -w 100 -h 100 -bc white -a tl -f tl.png
    roner.sh -shadow true -bc white -ibc efefef -w 100 -h 100 -aw 10 -ah 10 -sw 5 -o 0.99999 -f shbox.png
    
2. Deploy Roner.war on you tomcat server, then you can get images using the url:

    http://localhost:8080/Roner/rounded?c=blue&a=tl&w=100&h=100&bc=white
    http://localhost:8080/Roner/rounded?shadow=true&bc=white&ibc=efefef&w=100&h=100&aw=10&ah=10&sw=5&o=0.99999
    
    
Let me know if it is useful.
